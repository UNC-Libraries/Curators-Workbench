	<h1>Capturing Files</h1>
	<p>Capturing files brings files into a staging space (see Figure
		3). This is where you will be bringing those linked files into
		dedicated space.
	<p>
	<p>
		To capture files and folders:<br />
	<ol>
		<li>Select one or many files in the Original Folders section.
			(SHIFT, CTRL or OPTION can assist you in creating your selection.)</li>
		<li>Right-click on a selected file to bring up the context menu
			and choose "Capture".</li>
		<li>The file and all of its un-captured parent folders (up to the
			linked original) will be added to the Arrangement section.<br />
			NOTE: If a folder was previously captured and subsequently renamed or
			moved, the newly captured children will still appear in the
			rearranged folder.</li>
	</ol>
	During capture, the workbench automatically generates a checksum and
	stages the file to your preferred staging location. A progress bar will
	appear to show progress since it can take some time to move files from
	one server to another.
