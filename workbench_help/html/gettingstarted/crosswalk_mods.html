      <h1>Crosswalk Tabular Metadata to MODS</h1>
      <p>The Workbench is designed to facilitate the staging of large
	batches of objects with custom supplied metadata. The crosswalk tool is
	the key to mapping user-supplied metadata fields to MODS elements. It
	allows you to define how each MODS record is created, which elements
	are used and where they come from in the source metadata.
	<ol>
		<li>To start you must have your supplied metadata in
			tab-delimited format. This means that each record will be on a
			separate line in a text file. The fields in each record will be in a
			consistent order and separated by a special character, such as a comma or a TAB.</li>
		<li>Find the "Crosswalks" section on the left-hand navigation
			window. Right-click (ctrl-click on a Mac)</li>
		<li>In the context menu, select "Add Crosswalk".</li>
		<li>The Crosswalk Wizard will open. You may leave the default
			settings on the first screen and click "Next" to continue.</li>
		<li>Hit "Browse" and select the metadata file. Under "Character
			Set" choose "UTF-8". Click "Next".</li>
		<li>On this preview screen, you can test try different options
			until you are happy with the way the Workbench will interpret your
			metadata file. When satisfied, click "Finish".</li>
		<li>Now the Crosswalk Editor will open, showing you the canvas on
			which you will map metadata.</li>
	</ol>

		<b>To crosswalk MODS elements to your tab-delimited metadata</b>
	<ol>
		<li>Double-click on "XML Element" in the tools pallete on the right. A
			separate window will open displaying the range of MODS elements.
			Select an element (e.g. TitleInfo or Name) and click "OK".</li>
		<li>Some elements (e.g. name) have sub-elements available. In
			these cases, click on the element box to see a smaller pop-up. This
			pop-up allows you to refine the element further (in the previous
			example, "name" can be refined to "namePart", "displayForm", etc.).</li>
		<li>Click on "Input Connector" in the right tab, drag it from
			MODS element (e.g. title, topic, input) and drag it to the
			corresponding column on the left in the crosswalk file. <b>NOTE:</b>
			the arrow on your cursor will prompt you where you need to click. If
			there is a circle with a cross through it, you cannot add an input
			connector there. The same thing will happen to direct you where to
			click on metadata crosswalk file on the left.</li>
		<li>The key element that needs to be linked is the File/Folder
			Name Matcher. This field matches up the file names in the metadata
			file to the actual objects. Make sure to match this element to the
			proper metadata field in the crosswalk file.</li>
	</ol>
	Once the connectors are linked, there will be a green line between the
	MODS element and the crosswalked metadata. Link as many files as you
	like. When you close the crosswalk file, it will prompt you to save the
	file. Save it and it will be a part of the METS file that the Workbench
	is generating.
