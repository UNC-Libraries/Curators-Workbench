	<h1>Finish Up with an Export</h1>
	<p>When you are done staging the files and mapping metadata (if you
		have any), the system will have built out a robust METS file (see
		Figure 6) that contains the arrangement, location, UUID, checksums and
		MODS records for all the files you staged.</p>
	<p>To export your METS file, right-click on the project name in the
		Project Navigator window. Select "Export", and in the next dialog,
		select "Carolina Digital Repository Submission (METS)" under "Other".
		Click "Next". In the next dialog, specify the export location. The
		Workbench requires this to be in the Project workspace. Click "Finish"
		and presto--your METS file will be generated as an XML document.</p>
	<p>If you are not using the METS file as a manifest for ingest into
		a repository, you can use this METS file as a wrapper that documents
		relationships between files and metadata (both descriptive and
		technical). The wrapper can help provide a level of documentary
		control over collections if they are residing in a dark archive or
		some other secure server space.</p>
