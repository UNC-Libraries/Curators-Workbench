	<h1>Create or Edit a Description</h1>
	<p>Any item or folder in the arrangement section can be described
		with a MODS record. To create a MODS description for an item, just
		double-click on it or right-click and select "Edit MODS description".
		The MODS Editor will open.
	<p>In the Editor window, right-click (ctrl-click on a Mac) on the
		MODS tag (it should be the only line in the Editor). Select "New Child
		Element". From here, you can choose any number of MODS elements to
		add. Once you have, click the triangle next to the MODS tag to expand
		the record. You can either edit an element's value in the Properties
		window below, or add more elements (both siblings and children of your
		first element).</p>
