	<h1>Creating Your Project</h1>
	<p>Each SIP or group of objects you manage in the Workbench is
		called a "Project". You can work on numerous projects at once. To
		create a project,
	<ol>
		<li>Go to the File menu and select New > Workbench Project.</li>
		<li>Enter a project name and press "Finish".</li>
	</ol>
	</p>

	<p>Your project is divided up into three sections:
	<ul>
		<li><i>Original Folders</i> - Displays the original data you are
			collecting. These folders can be any folder on the local computer, a
			network drive or an iRods collection.</li>
		<li><i>Arrangement</i> - Shows a display containing any objects
			you have captured from the original folders. In this area you may
			rename, rearrange, describe and remove objects (such as file
			system-created objects, e.g. .DS_Store) in your submission.</li>
		<li><i><a href="crosswalks.html">Crosswalks</a> </i> - Holds the
			crosswalks to MODS metadata elements defined in your project.
			Crosswalks allow you to define mappings between tabular metadata
			records and MODS records for your projects.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
