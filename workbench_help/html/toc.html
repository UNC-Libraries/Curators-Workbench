	<h1>The Curator's Workbench User Guide</h1>
	<p>The Curator's Workbench is a tool to aid in the accession,
		arrangement, description and staging of digital objects. The tool
		helps archivists manage files before they are stored in a repository
		or stable storage. While the files are selected, arranged, and
		described, a METS file is generated by the software that documents
		these processes. In addition, MD5 checksums are generated for each
		object and validated after all copy operations. Custom metadata files
		may be mapped to MODS records and matched with objects.</p>

	<h3>Status of Help Documentation and User Assistance</h3>
	We are in the process of migrating and expanding upon existing how-to
	information. There isn't much to see in this help interface at the
	moment, but it is a work in progress. This embedded help has some
	advantages over PDFs and external sites:
	<ul>
		<li>Workbench dialogs and screens can be linked to relevant
			contextual help.</li>
		<li>Search, index and table of contents are within the
			application.</li>
		<li>"Cheat sheets" can guide the user through a task and may
			include links from the document back to the user interface.</li>
	</ul>
