	<h1>Help Documentation Status</h1>
	We are in the process of migrating and expanding upon existing how-to
	information. There isn't much to see in this help interface at the
	moment, but it is a work in progress. This embedded help will have some
	advantages over PDFs and external sites:
	<ul>
		<li>Workbench dialogs and screens can be linked to relevant contextual help.</li>
		<li>Search, index and table of contents are within the application.</li>
		<li>"Cheat sheets" can guide the user through a task and may
			include links from the document back to the user interface.</li>
	</ul>
