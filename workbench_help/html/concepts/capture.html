	<h1>Capture</h1>
	<p>Capture records information about an original file or folder in the METS manifest for a project.
		Once captured, originals are represented in the project <a href="arrangement.html">Arrangement</a>, which 
		is a view into the METS structMap for the project. Capture also records the original location of the file and date it was
		created. Captured originals are marked as captured. Captured files are queued for <a href="staging.html">staging</a> and checksum calculation.</p>
