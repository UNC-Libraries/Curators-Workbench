	<p>Capture records your originals in the METS manifest for a project.
		Once captured, originals will be represented in the project <a href="arrangement.html">arrangement</a>, which 
		is really a view into the METS structMap for the project. Captured originals
		are marked as captured and any files captured are also queued for <a href="staging.html">staging</a>.</p>
