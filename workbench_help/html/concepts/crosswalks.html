	<h1>Metadata Crosswalks</h1>
	<p>The Curator's Workbench facilitates the mapping of
		user-supplied metadata to a descriptive metadata standard. This is
		done via a crosswalk.</p>

	<p>
		A crosswalk is a table that shows equivalent elements in two metadata
		schemas. At it's most basic, a crosswalk shows a user where to put
		data from one scheme into a different scheme.<a href="#ref1"><sup>1</sup>
		</a>
	</p>

	<p>The workbench allows the user to map as much (or as little)
		metadata to MODS elements as they wish. This is helpful when the
		objects in the project have some metadata generated by the original
		user or repository staff. Mapping that metadata to MODS elements can
		automatically describe objects at the item-level, thereby reducing the
		amount of time repository staff must spend on a collection.</p>

	<p>When you create a crosswalk, you are telling the Workbench where
		the metadata resides, to which values it should pay attention, and to
		which standard elements the file's homegrown fields apply. This sounds
		like a lot of work, but the Workbench does much of it for you via a
		graphic interface reminiscint of creating relations between tables in
		a database application.</p>
