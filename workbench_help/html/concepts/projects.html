	<h1>Projects</h1>
	<p>Materials in the workbench are divided into projects within the
		work space. Depending on the size of a collection, the level or levels
		of granularity with which you plan to treat the collection, or other
		considerations, you may decide to use one or many projects to capture
		a collection.</p>

	<p>When deciding whether a collection will treated by one
		overarching project, or divided into a series of smaller projects, it
		is helpful to consider that the workbench generates a METS manifest
		file for each project. Larger collections may benefit from being
		chunked into smaller parts, for instance, an expansive, heterogeneous
		collection may be divided into more homogeneous units.
	<p>
	<p>Finally, while it is possible to work on many projects at once,
		this may slow the workbench's performance. By closing a project, the
		user may free up system resources for other projects, while still
		maintaining the work completed on the closed project until reopening.</p>
