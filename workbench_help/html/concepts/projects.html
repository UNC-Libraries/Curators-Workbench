	<h1>Projects</h1>
	<p>Materials in the workbench are divided into projects within the
		work space. Depending on the size of a collection, the level or levels
		of granularity with which you plan to treat the collection, or other
		considerations, you may decide to use one or many projects to capture
		a collection.</p>

	<p>When deciding whether a collection will treated by one
		overarching project, or divided into a series of smaller projects, it
		is helpful to consider that the workbench generates a METS manifest
		file for each project. Larger collections may benefit from being
		chunked into smaller parts, for instance, an expansive, heterogeneous
		collection may be divided into more homogeneous units.
	<p>
	<p>Finally, while it is possible to work on many projects at once,
		this may slow down workbench performance. By closing projects you will
		free up system resources, while
		retaining work completed within the closed project.</p>
