	<h1>Arrangement</h1>
	<p>After capture and staging, a logical representation of the
		original files appears in the Arrangement section of the Project
		Navigation window. This hierarchy can be edited. Files the user may
		not want to appear in the end result (e.g. metadata files or
		file-system generated files) may be removed from this hierarchy. At
		the point of capture, the logical hierarchy mirrors that of the
		original folder structure, but you may choose to modify this
		arrangement and organize materials differently (e.g. one may wish to
		facilitate the discovery of files by end-users).</p>

	<p>Additionally, item- and folder-level description may be added in
		the Arrangement section of the Project Navigation Window. Files and
		folders may be renamed. It is important to bear in mind that these
		changes only affect the logical representation of the files, not the
		originals themselves.</p>
