	<h1>Arrangement</h1>
	<p>
		After <a href="capture.html">capture</a> a logical representation of
		the original file tree appears in the arrangement section of the
		project navigator. The arrangement tree can be edited. All changes
		affect the logical representation of files in the METS manifest and
		have no affect on the original files.
	</p>

	<p>Files may be removed or deleted from the arrangement, which is
		the same as un-capturing them. When initially captured, the
		arrangement tree mirrors the original captured folder tree, but you
		may modify it and organize materials differently. For instance, you
		may want to create an arrangement that facilitates discovery of
		materials by end-users.</p>

	<p>The arrangement represents the objects as they are organized and
		described in the manifest and in the repository, after submission.
		File and folder-level descriptions may be added in the arrangement.
		Files and folders may be renamed.
	<p>If your repository supports compatible metadata, you can use the
		arrangement to assign many more properties to your objects:
	<ul>
		<li>assign roles to groups for access controls</li>
		<li>set default sort order for folders</li>
		<li>define collections and aggregate works</li>
		<li>assign thumbnail images to collection and other containers
			</p>
		<li>describe any part of the tree in a MODS record</li>
	</ul>
