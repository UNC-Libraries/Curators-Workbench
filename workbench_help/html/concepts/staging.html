	<h1>Staging</h1>
	<p>At the point of capturing a file, the workbench can also copy it
		to a staging location. This location can either be local (e.g. the
		Curator's Workbench project work space), in a secure repository (e.g.
		an iRODS repository), or on another network location.</p>

	<p>Before and after a file is copied, the workbench generates
		checksums and verifies these against each other. These checksums,
		along with the staging location, are added to the workbench manifest.</p>

	<p>
		You may not want files to be copied to a staging location. In this
		event, you can specify a <a href="prestaging.html">pre-staged
			location</a> for a set of originals. During the capturing process, your
		specified location will be added to the manifest and checksums will be
		generated and verified, but files will not be copied.
