	<h1>Metadata Dictionaries</h1>
	<p>
		Dictionaries streamline the process of mapping your custom metadata to
		objects in <a href="crosswalks.html">crosswalks</a> and <a
			href="forms.html">forms</a>. Dictionaries help you create crosswalks
		by conveniently packaging up your most common mappings and patterns
		for MODS elements. Dictionaries can be designed for all your most
		commonly used blocks of metadata and the crosswalk connections that
		are used to create them.
	</p>
	<p>Dictionaries allows users and groups to share and reuse standard
		MODS patterns without having to build complex crosswalks for each
		project. Dictionaries include labels and descriptive text to guide
		their use. They can be stored on network drives and shared by teams.</p>
