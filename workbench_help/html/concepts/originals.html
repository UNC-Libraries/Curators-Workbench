	<h1>Originals</h1>
	<p>Originals refer to the objects and files you are working on,
		although the term is a bit misleading. Although these are the data
		that the workbench allow you to inspect and capture, the workbench
		does not modify or move the original files, nor will it allow the user
		any means to modify, open, or delete the original files. For this
		reason, the workbench refers to adding originals to a project as
		"linking to originals".</p>
	<p>Once you point the workbench to the original files, they will
		appear in the Project Navigator window under Originals. The file tree
		will reflect their arrangment as it exists in the file system. While
		you can view the filenames and structure of the directories, you
		cannot modify the file in any way. If you wish to inspect its
		contents, you can open a copy in its default application by
		right-clicking a file. For instance, a .csv file will open a temporary
		copy in Microsoft Excel.</p>
