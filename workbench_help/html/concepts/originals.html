	<h1>Originals</h1>
	<p>Originals refer to the files and folders you are accessioning. 
		The workbench will only read and make copies of these original files and
		will not modify them. They are left in their original location on the local, 
		removable or network drive. For this reason we say that the project is
		"linked to originals", since originals are not really moved inside of the project.</p>
	<p>Once you link your project to some original files, they will
		appear in the Project Navigator window under Originals. The file tree
		under Originals will reflect their arrangement as it exists in the file system. While
		you can view the filenames and structure of the directories, you
		cannot modify files in any way.</p>
	<p>Many file viewers in your operating system are also editors. Therefore you
		risk altering a file when you open it in such a viewer. For this reason the workbench
		makes it convenient to open a temporary copy of any original file in the default viewer.
		If you wish to view an original file, right-click on it.
		For instance, a .xls file will be copied first and then the copy will open
		in Microsoft Excel.</p>
