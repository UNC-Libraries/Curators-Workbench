	<h1>Deposit Forms</h1>
	<p>The workbench now supports the design of deposit forms for
		particular audiences and uses. Forms are built from descriptive text
		blocks and data entry fields. The data entry fields are connected via
		crosswalk-like mappings to the intended MODS elements. Most of the time the
		mappings used in forms are taken from a <a href="dictionaries.html">data dictionary</a>.</p>
	<p>If you need to support web-based deposit of materials, then this
		forms feature is one approach to consider. The forms feature
		simplifies the creation of ad hoc deposit forms, shifting the design
		task from software developers to librarians and archivists, who are more familiar with
		the depositor community and MODS descriptive standards.</p>
	<p>Form definitions created in the workbench must be deployed to a
		web server in order to be used on the web. The CDR has written a
		form-based deposit service that performs repository ingest of
		described materials via the SWORD protocol. Similar form-based deposit services
		may be written to deposit via other protocols or to package submitted
		materials in a staging location.</p>
