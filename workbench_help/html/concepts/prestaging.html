	<h1>Pre-Staged Files</h1>
	<p>There are many work flow scenarios in which you do not need to
		stage files to a new location. In these situations the normal
		workbench staging behavior is unnecessary:
	<ul>
		<li>Files are already in a stable storage location but lack a
			manifest or fixity.</li>
		<li>Files are already readable by your repository ingest service.</li>
	</ul>
	In these situations, you can simply indicate that the originals are
	"pre-staged" at a given location URI. On capture, any pre-staged files will
	be checksummed and added to the manifest, but they will not be copied
	to a new location.
	</p>
	<p>Instead of copying the files, the workbench will compute a new
		"pre-staged" location URI for each file and put this URI into the
		manifest. This URI is considered the staged location for the file,
		even though the workbench did not copy it. Usually this location will
		be the network location of the original or some kind of agreed upon
		URI prefix.</p>
	<p>Note: If your files are being prestaged for ingest, then your
		pre-stage URIs should be resolvable by your repository ingest service.
		They can be any type of URI, even forms that are unknown to the
		workbench. In the CDR we use HTTP URIs for various pre-staged
		storage locations. The ingest code then resolves these URIs to local
		file paths.</p>
