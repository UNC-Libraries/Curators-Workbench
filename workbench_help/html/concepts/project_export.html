	<h1>Export and Import of Projects and Files</h1>
	<p>Once arrangement and description has been completed to your
		satisfaction, you may wish to export the project manifest. You may
		wish to export for submission into a repository. Alternately, you may
		want a compact, machine-readable inventory of the collection contents
		with a record of preliminary authentication, descriptive, and
		preservation activities performed. Currently, the workbench supports
		one export format: submission to the Carolina Digital Repository. The
		export format is a METS XML file, with MODS elements included from a
		crosswalk or other user-added description.</p>
	<p>Other forms of export are also available from the Export Menu. These 
		include:
		<ul>
			<li>Export Arrangement to CSV file</li>
			<li>Export (and Import) of project to ZIP archive</li>
			<li>Export of Arrangement to BagIt ZIP Package</li>
			<li>Export (and Import) of Crosswalks, Dictionaries, Forms and other individual project files</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Project export/import to ZIP can be used to share work between users. For instructions, see <a href="../tasks/export-import.html">Sharing Projects via Import and Export</a>.
	<p>Additional project exports are possible to support work flow
		needs. Share your needs on GitHub or via the users forum.</p>
