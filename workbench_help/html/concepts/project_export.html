	<h1>Export</h1>
	<p>Once arrangement and description has been completed to your
		satisfaction, you may wish to export the project manifest. You may
		wish to export for submission into a repository. Alternately, you may
		want a compact, machine-readable inventory of the collection contents
		with a record of preliminary authentication, descriptive, and
		preservation activities performed. Currently, the workbench supports
		one export format: submission to the Carolina Digital Repository. The
		export format is a METS XML file, with MODS elements included from a
		crosswalk or other user-added description.</p>
	<p>Other forms of export are also available from the Export Menu. These 
		include export of the project's Arrangement to a CSV file and export
		of the entire project to another location or a ZIP archive.</p>
	<p>New forms of project export are possible to support work flow
		needs. Share your needs on GitHub or via the users forum.</p>
