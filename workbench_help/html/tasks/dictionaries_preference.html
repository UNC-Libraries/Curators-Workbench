	<h1>Set up Preferred Data Dictionaries</h1>
	<p>The workbench can add your preferred data dictionaries to the tools palette of the MODS
	mapping editors, including the crosswalk editor, forms editor and the dictionary
	editor itself. In these editors the metadata blocks for each preferred dictionary are listed in an expandable menu. You
	can pick any metadata block from the palette and drop it on the canvas.</p>
	<p>Preferred dictionaries can be stored locally or on a network drive. This makes it possible
	to share common dictionaries across a team or institution. Each workbench can be configured with as many
	dictionaries as desired.</p>
	<p>Dictionaries are configured via the Preferences dialog, found in the menu under Help > Preferences.
	For more information, see <a href="../concepts/dictionaries.html">data dictionaries</a>.</p>
