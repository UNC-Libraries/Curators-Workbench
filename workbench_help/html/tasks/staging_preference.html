	<h1>Set up a Preferred Staging Location</h1>
	<p>
		Local staging, where files are staged within the project folder on
		your computer, is the default for new projects. However, you can add
		new staging locations in the <em>Staging</em> preferences section. A
		member of your technical staff might help in configuring this
		preference. A custom staging preference will help ensure that
		materials are staged in stable storage, file space that is off the
		local machine and backed up regularly.
	</p>
	<p>Staging preferences consist of a descriptive name and a location
		string with a special format. The location string is really a URI that
		indicates the location of a folder. Normal file paths start with
		"file:", for example on Windows there is usually a folder with this
		URI, "file:/C:/Windows". Note that the normal \ character has been
		replaced with /. This is a convention for URIs. You may insert special
		markers into your location URIs. These markers will be replaced with
		names related to the project or the user. Here are the markers you can
		use in staging URIs:
	<ul>
		<li>${PROJECT_HOME} - project folder path, for using a sub-folder</li>
		<li>${PROJECT_NAME} - name of the project, for using a central
			staging location</li>
		<li>${USER_NAME} - name of the user logged into this computer</li>
	</ul>
	The replacement values will be escaped to match URI syntax. The
	default "staging folder within project" preference provides an example of a URI string
	with a project location marker:
	<blockquote>${PROJECT_LOC}/stage</blockquote>
	Another URI scheme that is supported by the workbench is iRODS. When
	dealing with iRODS staging preferences and other network locations the
	replacement markers are especially helpful:
	<blockquote>irods://${USER_NAME}@my-vault.lib.edu:1247/myZone/home/${USER_NAME}/staging/${PROJECT_NAME}</blockquote>
