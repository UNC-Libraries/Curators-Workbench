/**
 * The <code>LoggerFactory</code> is a utility class producing Loggers for
 * various logging APIs, most notably for NLOG4J and JDK 1.4 logging. Other
 * implemenations such as {@link org.slf4j.impl.NOPLogger NOPLogger} and
 * {@link org.slf4j.impl.SimpleLogger SimpleLogger} are also supported.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>LoggerFactory</code> is essentially a wrapper around an
 * {@link ILoggerFactory} instance bound with <code>LoggerFactory</code> at
 * compile time.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Please note that all methods in <code>LoggerFactory</code> are static.
