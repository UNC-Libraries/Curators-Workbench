				>In normal work flow the workbench carefully copies captured files to a staging location. The "Pre-Staged Originals"
					feature lets you assert that a set of Originals are already staged, and where. In the Link Originals Wizard you may
					indicate the location in which the originals are already staged. This feature allows you to prepare materials that
					are already in a safe staging location without creating redundant copies. Staged locations are now listed in the
					Properties view for files in the Arrangement.</text>

				>We had a request that we support linking to multiple original folders within the same interface. This request, plus
					the need for the pre-staging option, led to a rework of the whole "Link Originals" wizard. The new dialog lets you
					pick a top folder, then browse within it to choose which sub-folder or files to link. Pre-stage locations are
					entered relative to the top folder.</text>

				&lt;li&gt;Starting writing integrated help, including this screen!&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;SIP Export let's you choose the file name and location.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;In Crosswalk editor, double-click to select new element or attribute type.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;In Crosswalk editor, date matchers come with a default set of date patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;In Navigator, reordered and regrouped pop-up menus to reflect common work flow.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;In Navigator, removed irrelevant pop-up menus inherited from Eclipse platform.&lt;/li&gt;
