			>This release includes new work flow support and several features requested by users:</text>
			<group
				label="Reusable Crosswalks and Data Dictionaries"
				id="dictionaries-group"
				style-id="content-group"
			>
				<text
					style-id="group-description"
				>In previous releases each crosswalk was a separate effort, involving deep knowledge of the MODS schema and
				the user supplied metadata. Now crosswalks can be copied between projects and used again. They can also
				take advantage of common MODS mappings from a shared data dictionary. This means that not everyone creating
				crosswalks needs to be a MODS expert. It also makes building crosswalks far less time consuming.</text>

			<group
				label="Originals and Drives"
				id="originals-group"
				style-id="content-group"
			>
				<text
					style-id="group-description"
				>We've rebuilt the originals part of the workbench to better track drives and maintain the connection between groups of
				originals and original media. This means we have a clearer interface and better support for removable drives.</text>
			</group>
			<group
				label='Image Preview'
				id="preview-group"
				style-id="content-group"
			>
				<text>When you highlight an image file, either in the originals tree or the arrangement, you can see a preview
				of the image in the workbench. This saves a lot of time for those working with image collections. The preview window can
				be arranged and sized according to your work flow needs.</text>
			</group>
			<group
				label='Exports, Exports, Exports'
				id="exports-group"
				style-id="content-group"
			>
				<text>We added export support for a variety of identified work flow needs. A BagIt ZIP export function delivers
				project-based packages meeting this widely used standard. The project arrangement can now also be exported as a comma-separated file.
				This was implemented to support a local EAD authoring scenario, but may be useful to others. You can also now export entire projects
				to a ZIP file or a shared drive. This was done to support multi-user work flows and projects with a significant wait
				between the capture step and arrangement or description. Individual files, such as crosswalks and data dictionaries, can also
				be exported and imported across project and workbench installations.</text>
			</group>
			<group
				label='Deposit Form Designer'
				id="forms-group"
				style-id="content-group"
			>
				<text>Using dictionary and crosswalk mapping components, you can now build deposit forms suitable for a particular
				content stream. The deposit forms map the input fields you choose to the MODS schema or dictionary elements. Form designs also
				include explanatory text and designation of required fields. Forms work in tandem with a server-side form-hosting 
				application. The form-hosting application may be configured to put uploads and MODS into a folder or to perform repository
				deposit via SWORD.</text>
