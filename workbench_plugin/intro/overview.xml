			<text style-id="group-description">The Curatorâ€™s Workbench is a
				collection preparation and work flow tool for digital materials. It
				is designed to
				acquire and process file structures efficiently while
				giving archivists and other curators control over their work.
				The
				workbench can assist with accession, arrangement, description and
				staging of digital objects and is commonly
				used to prepare batch
				submissions to a repository. The workbench provides information and
				controls to help you
				select and arrange. It handles routine
				accessioning tasks for you, such as staging files, generating
				checksums and
				building a manifest file. The main workbench window is
				divided into three parts. The Project Navigator area is on
				the left
				side of the workbench. It displays all the projects in your
				workspace and their contents. Each project is
				divided into three
				sections, which are Originals, the Arrangement and Crosswalks.

				<text>Each project in the workbench has a corresponding METS XML
					document within the project folder. This METS
					document is the
					manifest in which the workbench records all the information about
					captured materials and
					descriptive records. You will not normally
					need to edit this file, but you may find it interesting to view.

			<link style-id="content-link" label="Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS)"

				<text>The workbench supports schema-driven editing of MODS records
					for all captured objects. It also includes a
					unique crosswalk
					feature that can help you migrate tabular metadata to MODS records
					and match these records with
					captured files or folders.

				<text>The workbench was originally created to facilitate repository
					ingest at UNC Chapel Hill and was designed with
					that repository in
					mind. Others will have different systems in mind and different
					metadata needs. If you have
					questions about extending the software,
					please get in touch with us. The workbench itself is an extension
					of the
					Eclipse software platform and was designed with future
					extensions in mind.

				<text>Materials in the workbench are divided into projects within a
					work space. You may choose to use one or many
					projects to capture a
					collection. Each project is represented in a METS manifest file
					that contains an arrangement
					of the captured material. While you may
					work on many projects at once, inactive may be closed to improve
					workbench
					performance.

			<link style-id="content-link" label="Capture"

				<text>Capture makes an original part of your manifest, including it

			<link style-id="content-link" label="Staging"
				url="http://org.eclipse.ui.intro/showHelpTopic?id=/workbench_help/html/concepts/staging.html"
				id="java">
				<text>When you capture a file, the workbench can copy it to a
					staging location. Checksums are calculated before and
					after each
					file is copied and are verified. The checksum and staged location
					are added to the workbench manifest.
					You may also specify a
					pre-staged location for a set of originals. When pre-staged files
					are captured, the staged
					location for the manifest is inferred and
					the file is checksummed, but not copied.

			<link style-id="content-link" label="Arrangement"
				url="http://org.eclipse.ui.intro/showHelpTopic?id=/workbench_help/html/concepts/arrangement.html"
				id="java">
				<text>An arrangement is the logical hierarchy within which captured
					folders and files are organized and described.
					When files are first
					captured their arrangement reflects the original file system. You
					may choose to modify the
					arrangement to organize materials
					differently.

			<link style-id="content-link" label="Metadata Crosswalks"
				url="http://org.eclipse.ui.intro/showHelpTopic?id=/workbench_help/html/concepts/crosswalks.html"
				id="java">
				<text>A crosswalk allows you to define custom mappings between
					tabular metadata records (such as spreadsheets) and
					descriptive
					records. Crosswalk mappings are created through a schema-driven
					visual editor. Crosswalked records are
					regenerated each time the
					crosswalk mappings are saved.

				url="http://org.eclipse.ui.intro/showHelpTopic?id=/workbench_help/html/concepts/dictionaries.html"
				id="java">
				<text>Dictionaries allows users and groups to share and reuse
					standard
					MODS patterns without having to build complex crosswalks for each
					project. Dictionaries include labels and descriptive text to guide
					their use. They can be stored on network drives and shared by
					teams.

				url="http://org.eclipse.ui.intro/showHelpTopic?id=/workbench_help/html/concepts/project_export.html"
				id="java">
				<text>When you are satisfied with the arrangement and description of
					your materials, you may want to export the
					project. Export will save
					the project manifest into another format, usually a submission
					format for a repository.
					Currently the workbench supports one export
					format, which is for submission to the Carolina Digital Repository.
