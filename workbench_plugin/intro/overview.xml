								<p>The Curatorâ€™s Workbench is a collection preparation and work flow tool for digital materials. It is designed
										to acquire and process file structures efficiently while giving archivists and other curators control over
										their work. The workbench can assist with accession, arrangement, description and staging of digital objects
										and is commonly used to prepare batch submissions to a repository.</p>
								<p>The workbench provides information and controls to help you make informed decisions. The main workbench
										window is divided into three parts.</p>
								<p>The Project Navigator area is on the left side of the workbench. It displays all the projects in your
										workspace and their contents. Each project is divided into three sections, which are Originals, the
										Arrangement and Crosswalks.</p>
