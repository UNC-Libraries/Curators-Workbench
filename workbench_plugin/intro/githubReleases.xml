				<text>This is the current release and comes with many features requested by users. Several features will assist users in a team
				environment, such as many project import/export options and more reusable metadata mapping in crosswalks and via
				data dictionaries. Support for removable drives was expanded and we added support for alphabetized folders. There
				is also now an image preview for originals or items in the arrangement. A new feature added for CDR work flow is
				design of ad hoc deposit forms. A visual editor lets users build deposit forms, mapping input fields to MODS records.
				These forms can be deployed to a form-hosting service and used to make repository deposits via SWORD.</text>

				<text>This release added support for pre-staged originals and addressed some usability concerns

				<text>Release 2 revamped crosswalk definitions to allow greater flexibility and addressed many production issues for
					the Carolina Digital Repository. It added access control settings to the Arranged objects and allowed linking of
					folders to their surrogate images.</text>
