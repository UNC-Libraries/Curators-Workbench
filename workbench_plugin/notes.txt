Persistence in Workspace/Staging Area:

project_name.producer_mets.xml
 - file section for each data set with identifier
  - relative paths..
  - access configuration somewhere outside METS
 - original structMap for each data set
  - selection (yes/no)
  - status (unstaged/staged/original missing)
 - digProvMDSec for each div that is altered by curator
  - record processing events as they happen to each div

project_name.submission_mets.xml
 - final form METS goes here

Workbench
 * commands:
     * Open Project, Save Project, Close Project, Exit
 * views:
     * navigator
     * file summary, file preview

Navigator Resources:

File Sets
 * maps to a single fileSec in a working METS file
 * has associated structMap for original structure
 * fileSec contains a fileGrp with USE of SOURCE_PATHS
  * contains relative path for each file in source
 * fileSec contains a fileGrp with USE of STAGED_PATHS
  * as files are staged file elements are added
  * checksums are filled in
  * source and staged file share a GROUPID
 * FileSet API:
     * setLabel(String), getLabel()
     * setSource(FileSource), getSource()
     * TreeFileSource testRoot(), crawl()
     * getSourceStructure()
     * setStage(FileStage), getStage()
     * FileStage openOutputStreamToStage(filepath), checksum(filepath), getURL(filepath), exists(filepath)
 * commands:
     * test connection, (re)crawl source
     * (re)stage, unstage, pause (when staging), resume (when partially staged)
 * views:
     * properties and status
     * file selection

Extracted Metadata
 * harvesters produce XML or tabular metadata on a per file basis (all rows mapped)
 * may come bundled with preconfigured mappings to MODS, etc..
 
Supplied Metadata
 * map of row to div
 * each metadata set is a source to be mapped to divs
 
Submission Structure
 * METS structMap tree w/annotations
 * open editor view or use navigator?
